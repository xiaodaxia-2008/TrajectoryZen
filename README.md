A concise and fast re-implementetation based on [A New Approach to Time-Optimal Path Parameterization Based on Reachability Analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318671280_A_New_Approach_to_Time-Optimal_Path_Parameterization_Based_on_Reachability_Analysis), there also has a [*official* implementation by the thesis's author](https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra.git).
